## Details

### Overview
This feature provides the ability for a Supervisor to barge in to a call (i.e. join an active call with an agent) or coach and agent (IE talk only to the agent where the caller(s) are unable to hear you), all from the Team's View.
There are addtiional features that have been added to allow the Agent to see who is actively coaching them along with giving the Supervisor the ability to go into a "private/incognito" mode if they wish to. The additional features require specific feature flags to be enabled, which we will review in the setup and dependencies section below.
